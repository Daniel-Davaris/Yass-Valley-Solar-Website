                    Off-Grid power systems can deliver a great alternative to expensive grid infrastructure and independence from grid power. Living off the grid is a great experience and modern systems mean that you will notice few differences from grid power.<br>
                    <br> While Off-Grid systems can deliver extensive amounts of electricity, it is certainly a decision that has to be considered carefully. Some of the factors to include are:

                    The size of an off-grid system is measured in kW (kilowatt) hours per day and it tells us how much power the system is designed to provide on an average day. This value is different to the kW of the solar array and factors in things such as the size of
                    the battery system and amount of generator run time. <br>

                    <br> We believe that the design stage is the most crucial part of an off-grid system. We work with you to understand your needs and determine the right system size system. As an off-grid system provides power to many different appliances
                    and plays a large role in the operations of a house we take a holistic approach to the design and provide consultation regarding house energy design and appliance selection.
